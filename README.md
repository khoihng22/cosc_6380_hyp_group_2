## Introduction
In this repository, we have tried to implement hypothesis testing on the 8 hypotheses by python. The 8 hypotheses of our group are:
- The average monthly temperature in Corpus Christi follows a normal distribution.   
- Climate does not affect the number of people on state benefits. 
- Too hot equal to no rain. 
- The higher population density correlates with higher average PM2.5 levels in the air.  
- Rainfall leads to a decrease in recent pm2.5 levels, applicable to most regions.  
- In Corpus Christi, when the monthly average temperature gets higher, the monthly average wind speed will also get higher. 
- Satellite Vegetation coverage correlates with monthly Avg Precipitation. 
- The monthly average wind speed in Corpus Christi per year in the period 2000-2024 follows a normal distribution. 

## Methodology
We applied some of the quantitative analyses to prove (disprove) our hypotheses, such as:
- Perform a t-test
- Use paired tests
- Plot the data in various ways (seaborn package is useful)
- Try a Chi-square test
- Do a z-test
- Perform a regression
- Perform ANOVA

## Result

## Conclusion
