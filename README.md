## Introduction
In this repository, we have tried to implement hypothesis testing on the 8 hypotheses by python. The 8 hypotheses of our group are:
- Climate does not affect the number of people on state benefits​.
- Too hot is not equal to no rain​.
- The higher population density correlates with higher average PM2.5 levels in the air.​
- Rainfall leads to a decrease in recent pm2.5 levels, applicable to most regions.​
- Temperature increase wind speed increase and the opposite​.
- Satellite Vegetation coverage correlates with monthly Avg Precipitation.
- Average monthly temperature in Corpus Christi follows a normal distribution.
- The monthly precipitation of in the Corpus Christi. for the years 2000-2024 does not follow a normal distribution.

## Methodology
We applied some of the quantitative analyses to prove (disprove) our hypotheses, such as:
- Perform a t-test
- Use paired tests
- Plot the data in various ways (seaborn package is useful)
- Try a Chi-square test
- Do a z-test
- Perform a regression
- Perform ANOVA

## Result

## Conclusion
